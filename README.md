# MTP
As part of this project, numerous data is accumulated concerning engine condition, fuel level, smoke and gas
levels, brake condition, vehicle speed, trip distance, cumulative traveled distance with the help of different sensors
and send the complete information to a Microcontroller(MCU). The MCU(here Shakti) transfers this information
to a centralized server. The server further shares this information with the customer, vendor, and police based on
their requirements. Sensor information will be transmitted via the CAN transceiver, and the GPRS modem will be
a wireless means of connecting to the central server.
Additionally, GPS can be interfaced with the vehicle to provide real-time location information. The map will
show the location information along with the speed limit in a particular area. If the rider crosses the limit, the rider
will be penalized. In case of theft, vehicle tracking, vehicle locking can be an additional feature.
